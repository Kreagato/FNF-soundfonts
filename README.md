# FNF-soundfonts
Plug in the .wavs into the slicex plugin in fl, and for ruvC use edison.
I did not make the sf2 files or boyfriends chromatic scale, and all of the sf2's can be found on gamebanana (bf chromatic was from kawaisprite lol.)
PLS credit the ones that i made if you use them (maybe even link my channel?) it would help a lot and i would appreciate it. 
enjoy!
